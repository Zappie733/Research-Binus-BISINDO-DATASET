This repository contains datasets related to our paper [BISINDO Hand-Sign Detection Using Transfer Learning](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRAIE59459.2023.10468194).

## Data Collection: BISINDO Hand Sign
The dataset consists of 20 photos for each character (i.e., A-Z). All the photos were taken using smartphone camera (i.e., Redmi Note 10 Pro) and processed using Python OpenCV. The same setting parameter are applied to all the photos (e.g, light intensity, and distance). The total number of photos in the dataset is 520 photos.

## Data Labeling
All photos are labelled using a Python package called [labelImg](https://pypi.org/project/labelImg/1.4.0/). Each photo have a label in the form of an XML file that contains information, such as photo’s directory, name, size, label, box coordinates, etc. The XML structure is shown below.

## Data Processing
The images are in the [collected images](https://github.com/rhiosutoyo/Research-Binus-BISINDO-DATASET/tree/master/collectedimages) folder. The dataset is separated into two groups, training and testing, with a ratio of 4:1.
- [Training](https://github.com/rhiosutoyo/Research-Binus-BISINDO-DATASET/tree/master/train)
- [Testing](https://github.com/rhiosutoyo/Research-Binus-BISINDO-DATASET/tree/master/test)
